# Hi, I’m Denis (aka Gelerion)

I’m a Principal Software Engineer at Salesforce, based in Israel, and I’ve been building high-performance microservices, streaming data platforms, and AI-powered applications for over a decade.

On this blog you’ll find deep-dives, tutorials and “war stories” about:

- 🚀 **Microservices & Architectures** (Spring Boot, JOOQ, Kafka, API-Frist, DB-Frist)  
- 🔄 **Streaming & Lakehouse Architectures** (Data Governance, Data Quality, Apache Flink, Iceberg/Delta, Trino)  
- 🤖 **Agentic AI & RAG** (OpenAI, Vector DBs, RAG)  
- 📈 **Performance tuning & JVM Internals** (Profiling, GC-tweaks, Benchmarking)  
- 🛠️ **Production-Grade Tooling** (Terraform, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Argo, Observability)

If you’re curious about **scalable systems**, **low-latency pipelines**, or **engineering at the intersection of data and AI**, you’ll feel right at home here.

## My design philosophy
  
> “Conventions guide, but never dictate.”

1. **Pragmatic Architecture**  
   Choose practical architectures and tools that deliver clear business value and adapt smoothly as needs evolve.

2. **Reliable Data by Design**  
   Data quality, lineage, and trustworthiness aren’t optional—they’re foundational.

3. **Performance as a Habit**  
   Make profiling, optimization, and proactive performance tuning integral parts of the development lifecycle.

4. **Observability First**  
   Provide deep visibility through logging, metrics, and tracing to continuously improve reliability and speed.
