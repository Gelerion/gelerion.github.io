# Hi, I’m Denis (aka Gelerion)

I’m a Principal Software Engineer at Salesforce, based in Israel, and I’ve been building **high-performance microservices**, **streaming data platforms**, and **AI-powered applications** for over a decade.

On this blog you’ll find deep-dives, tutorials and “war stories” about:

- 🚀 **Microservices & JVM internals** (Spring Boot, JOOQ, Kafka, Vert.x)  
- 🔄 **Streaming & Lakehouse architectures** (Apache Flink, Iceberg, Trino)  
- 🤖 **Agentic AI & RAG** (OpenAI, vector DBs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  
- 📈 **Performance tuning** (profiling, GC-tweaks, benchmarking)  
- 🛠️ **Production-grade tooling** (Terraform, Kubernetes, monitoring)

If you’re curious about **scalable systems**, **low-latency pipelines**, or **engineering at the intersection of data and AI**, you’ll feel right at home here.
